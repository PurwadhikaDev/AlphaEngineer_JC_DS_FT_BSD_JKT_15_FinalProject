## Background
<p align='justify' style="font-weight: bold;">
Philadelphia city is one of the hottest real estate market in the US. With high increment every year, its property price is suprisingly lower compared to other cities in the US. That said, with lowered home demand index in 2022 compared to 2021, this is the best time for property agent to actively promote its remaining properties listed. In this project, we will aid the promotion by providing predicted market value of properties obtained by machine learning model. Hopefully, it will reduce the cost of property appraisal. And also, with a justified market value based on property characteristics and location, both buyer and seller will be benefitted, thus hypothetically will lead to increase in success transaction of properties.

## Dataset Source
<p align='justify' style="font-weight: bold;">
This is a real-world data of properties in Philadelphia city. You can download it from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adebayo/philadelphia-buildings-database">Kaggle</a> or <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adebayo/philadelphia-buildings-database">City of Philadelphia: Metadata Catalog</a>.

## Methodology
### Data Understanding
<p align='justify' style="font-weight: bold;">
With such an enormous dataset with a lot of columns and rows, we first need to know what information the dataset has. From a thorough investigation, we summarize them in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WapgNftGZMUBt6H2SkDbNedN6vAwY56xvdr9P1My-30/edit#gid=781668512">Spreadsheet</a>. 
</p>

### Data Cleaning
<p align='justify' style="font-weight: bold;">
First, we pick columns which informative enough to help us fill the missing value and anomalies in the dataset based on its description. Thus, reducing the columns. Then, initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to match the column description with the data, also to detect and correcting missing values and anomalies. Furthermore, after correcting missing values, this section resulting in clean dataset, free from missing values. <a href="https://github.com/PurwadhikaDev/AlphaEngineer_JC_DS_FT_BSD_JKT_15_FinalProject/blob/main/1.%20Background%20and%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb">Jupyter</a>
</p>

### Detailed EDA
<p align='justify' style="font-weight: bold;">
Detailed EDA to further understand the characteristics and correlations of the features and label to determine the proper preprocessing of the data. This section will also help us in gaining insights about feature engineering. <a href="https://github.com/PurwadhikaDev/AlphaEngineer_JC_DS_FT_BSD_JKT_15_FinalProject/blob/main/2.%20Detailed%20EDA.ipynb">Jupyter</a>
</p>

### Modeling
#### Feature Selection
<p align='justify' style="font-weight: bold;">
We select the features used in the model building based on evidence in detailed EDA and also on the basis of domain knowledge.
